  My Portfolio Site

## :paw_prints: Overview
Link to site: [https://www.aadhilah.com](https://www.aadhilah.com)
    This portfolio site was created using:
    - Gatsby for frontend framework
    - Bulma for CSS framework 
    - Sass for CSS 

  **Description**

    I created this site to showcase my projects. 
    
    Gatsby was chosen due to its simplicity of rendering static pages based on performance, thorough documentation, and useful plugins specifically created for the framework. 
    
    Bulma was used for styling, as it was quick to get started with and also has great documentation.
